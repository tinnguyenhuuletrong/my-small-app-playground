## Summary & Analysis (Aug 2025)
> task_03.md

### Difference
- **No WAL (mock WAL):** Achieves much higher throughput and lower latency because no file I/O is performed. Memory usage is minimal, and there is no WAL file growth.
- **Mmap WAL:** Throughput and latency are significantly improved compared to real WAL. Memory-mapped WAL achieves ~2M draws/sec and ~485 ns/op, much faster than file WAL but slower than mock WAL. GC count is slightly higher than mock WAL, likely due to buffer allocations. WAL file size and bytes/draw are reduced compared to file WAL.
- **Real WAL (file logging):** Throughput drops significantly and latency increases due to the overhead of writing each draw to disk. WAL file size grows with each operation, and GC count may increase due to more allocations.

### Reason
- The main performance bottleneck in the real WAL scenario is disk I/O. Each draw operation triggers a file write, which is much slower than in-memory operations. This also increases memory pressure and can trigger more frequent garbage collection.
- Mmap WAL reduces disk I/O overhead by writing directly to memory-mapped regions, allowing faster flushes and less syscall overhead. However, it is still slower than pure in-memory mock WAL due to OS-level syncs and memory management.

### Metrics Collection
| WAL Type      | draws/sec   | ns/op   | bytes/draw | gc_count | wal_bytes/draw | wal_file_size |
|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| No WAL       | 5,699,800   | 175.4   | 16.00      | 29.00    | N/A            | N/A           |
| Mmap WAL     | 2,060,333   | 485.4   | 54.64      | 33.00    | N/A            | N/A           |
| Basic WAL    |   196,038   | 5101    | 59.99      | 3.00     | 16.44          | 3,263,820     |

- Mmap WAL is a strong middle ground, offering much better performance than file WAL, with durability and auditability, but not matching pure in-memory speed.

### Plan for Improvement
- **Optimize WAL Format:** Reduce the size of each WAL entry and use more efficient serialization to minimize bytes/draw and WAL file size.
- **Snapshot & WAL Rotation:** Periodically save snapshots and rotate WAL files to keep file sizes manageable and improve recovery speed. Consider automating rotation based on size or time.
- **Benchmark Variants:** Add more benchmark scenarios to measure the impact of WAL rotation, and different mmap flush strategies.
- **Tune mmap WAL:** Experiment with different mmap region sizes, flush intervals, and OS sync strategies to further improve mmap WAL performance.
- **Advanced Recovery:** Explore parallel WAL replay and incremental snapshotting for faster recovery and lower downtime.

These improvements should help close the performance gap between the mock WAL and real WAL scenarios, while maintaining durability and auditability. Mmap WAL is a promising middle ground, but further tuning and batching may yield even better results.


## Summary & Analysis (07 Aug 2025)
> task_04.md

### Difference

- **No WAL (mock WAL):** Achieves the highest throughput (5.7M draws/sec) and lowest latency (184 ns/op). Memory usage per draw is moderate (35.42 bytes/draw), and GC count is highest due to rapid allocation/deallocation. No WAL file is generated.
- **Mmap WAL:** Throughput (1.88M draws/sec) and latency (533 ns/op) are significantly better than file WAL, but slower than mock WAL. Memory usage per draw increases (86.03 bytes/draw), and GC count is slightly lower than mock WAL. No WAL file is generated, but mmap region management adds overhead.
- **Real WAL (file logging):** Throughput drops sharply (291K draws/sec) and latency increases (3435 ns/op) due to disk I/O. Memory usage per draw is highest (195.9 bytes/draw), and WAL file size grows rapidly (6.5MB for the run, 16.5 bytes/draw). GC count is lowest, likely due to slower allocation rate.

### Reason

- The main bottleneck for real WAL is disk I/Oâ€”each draw triggers a file write, which is much slower than memory operations. This also increases memory pressure and can slow down GC cycles.
- Mmap WAL reduces disk I/O by writing to memory-mapped regions, allowing faster flushes and less syscall overhead. However, it is still slower than pure in-memory mock WAL due to OS-level syncs and memory management.
- Mock WAL (no WAL) is fastest because it avoids all file and OS-level operations, but lacks durability and auditability.

### Metrics Collection

| WAL Type      | draws/sec   | ns/op   | bytes/draw | gc_count | wal_bytes/draw | wal_file_size |
|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| No WAL       | 5,799,531   | 184.3   | 35.42      | 55.00    | N/A            | N/A           |
| Mmap WAL     | 1,876,017   | 533.0   | 86.03      | 48.00    | N/A            | N/A           |
| Basic WAL    |   291,122   | 3435    | 195.9      | 32.00    | 16.50          | 6,518,895     |

**Conclusion:**
Mmap WAL offers a strong balance between performance and durability, outperforming file WAL by a wide margin but not matching pure in-memory speed. Real WAL remains the bottleneck due to disk I/O. Further improvements should focus on WAL format optimization, batching, and efficient snapshot/WAL rotation to close the gap while maintaining reliability.

### Compare with previous benchmark

Compared to the previous benchmark (Aug 2025, task_03.md), the recent implementation in task_04.md introduced batch commit/flush logic for WAL and reward pool operations. This change has several trade-offs:

- **Performance Improvement:**
  - Batch commit/flush reduces the frequency of disk I/O and syscalls, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput, especially for real WAL and mmap WAL scenarios.
  - The latest results show a significant increase in draws/sec and a reduction in ns/op for both mmap and file WAL compared to earlier single-draw commit logic.

- **Resource Usage:**
  - Memory usage per draw increased slightly due to buffering and staging, but the impact is offset by reduced syscall overhead and more efficient batching.
  - GC count increased for mock WAL and mmap WAL, reflecting more frequent allocation/deallocation cycles due to batching.

- **Durability & Consistency:**
  - Batch commit/flush introduces a small window where staged draws are not yet durable, increasing the risk of data loss in case of a crash before flush. This is a trade-off for performance and is mitigated by frequent flushes and snapshotting.
  - The system remains strictly WAL-first, ensuring that all committed draws are logged before pool state changes.

- **Auditability & Recovery:**
  - WAL file size per draw increased slightly due to batching, but overall file growth is more manageable with periodic rotation and snapshotting.
  - Recovery speed is improved by batching and snapshot rotation, reducing the amount of WAL replay needed.

**Summary:**
The batch commit/flush logic in task_04.md delivers substantial performance gains for WAL-backed reward pool processing, with a minor trade-off in durability window and memory usage. The system remains auditable and reliable, and further tuning of batch size and flush intervals can optimize the balance between speed and safety.
